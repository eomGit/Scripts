# Scripts
Random Scripts

Searchindex.ps1	is a simple powershell scrip that I created to help me find a file or email I was looking for. The Windows Search through explorer was never ideal for me and this just cuts that middle man out. I needed this due to having tons of OS scripts, database scripts, and emails that I would have to search and find what I did or why I did some action in my IT role.

lwresttest.ps1 is a simple powershell script that I used to be able to connect to a LabWorks web server.

sonarqube.ps1 is a powershell script that I used via a scheduled task to download a TFS project and import it into sonarqube so that sonarqube can do code analaysis.

tfs-basic-functions.ps1 is a basic powershell script I created to allow me to modify work items from TFS.
